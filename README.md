The aim of the script is to:
1. Load Kaggle dataset with credit information of a sample of borrowers
2. Visualize the data, get a better understanding of its characteristics
3. Resample the dataset to account for an imbalance present (much less defaults than no defualts)
4. Fit the Logistic Regression model
5. Inspect the model fit and other classification metrics (precision, recall, confusion matrix etc)
